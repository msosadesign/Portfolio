						<h3 class="page__main__title">The Landing Fork Design Iterations</h3>
						<p>The Landing Fork has returned, and they want some Design Iterations. They liked the <a href="wireframe.html" class="link">wireframe</a> (yes!) so they wanted me to make a high fidelity version. The thing is, they wanted me to make one design based on tech-savvy elder people, and another one based on their baking products. For the tech-savvy elder audience, I implemented a bigger font size, some social media links to increase social engagement and filter search to help them find a specific topic. For the baking products focused iteration, I dedicated the sidebar for this, making a “Popular Baking Toolkits” section so that people can start baking with all their necessary tools, and I also added a "Tools Used" button to see which products were implemented for cooking the recipe.</p>
                        <p>This project taught me how different objectives means different designs, and how to make variations to reach these objectives.</p>
                        <h4>Project's Problem</h4>
                        <p>My objective in this project was to design two different iterations based on the current points to improve:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Iteration 1: "put a focus on the business' baking products."</li>
                            <li>Iteration 2: "increase their audience of tech-savvy elderly women."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you can see, two different objectives, but we can take the original wireframe from the previous project and repurpose it to solve these needs.</p>
                        <h4>Project's Audience</h4>
                        <p>As indicated above, we have at least one clear audience: tech-savvy elderly women. It's good to know that their tech-savvy, because this means they're familiar with the most common website navigation and design patterns, otherwise, we would need to make it as easy as possible for them to interact with the blog. The fact that they're elderly means that they have more problem reading screens and text in general, therefore we need to make headings, body and images bigger, but being careful to not exaggerate and keep a visually aesthetic hierarchy.</p>
                        <p>The audience of the baking products would normally be people that want to learn it, hardly someone is going to bake for need. An example could be that someone's birthday is coming, so a loved ones searches for recipes online for baking cakes. Celebrations in general include some baked food. Another example could be people that want to learn to bake bread because the one on the supermarket it's not up for their expectations or it's expensive. Therefore, people that want to learn, people with passion. Finally, the last example that comes to mind could be, a chef student, who could benefit from having all the products necessary for the baking.</p>
                        <p>I made a similar but more general analysis of the audience in my <a href="wireframe.html" class="link">previous project</a>:</p>
                        <p>"From the website description, it seems that the brand aims to sell products through content marketing, in other words, writing and sharing blog posts showing how to make cool recipes with the implementation of their own products. From this perspective, we can understand who the audience is: anyone who is interested in learning new recipes, this wide demographic could fall on particularly these people: those who are living alone for the first time and need to learn to cook, boyfriends and girlfriends, husbands and wives, fathers, mothers and grandmothers who want to surprise their sons and those who want to learn for passion. Finally, we can narrow this people by age, from 18 to 70 years old, most probably living with their loved ones."</p>
                        <h4>My Process</h4>
                        <p>I already created the original wireframe on Adobe Xd, so I had an easy start. I had made two wireframes and chose the best one:</p>
                            <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                                <figure>
                                   <img src="./images/Projects/2_Wireframe/wireframe1.png">
                                    <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/2_Wireframe/wireframe1.png" class='button'>Original Wireframe</a></figcaption>
                                </figure>
				            </div>
                        <p>From here, I looked at my design, considered the audiences, their needs, and started sketching.</p>
                        <p>This is the baking products focused sketch, the first thing that came to mind was including the used tools in the recipes, this way, users can read them and know that they can get the tools if they wanted to. Besides this, I considered new ideas for the sidebar, such as top rated recipes, categories of food, and toolkits for type of cuisine. Toolkits would be boxes that bring everything needed for cooking a new type of food, like tools, special ingredients, seasonings, etc.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/sketch1.jpg">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/sketch1.jpg" class="button">Baking Sketch</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <p>I chose what I liked and recreated it using the original wireframe from the previous project, I included an easy glance of the tools used in each recipe that would show them with a mouse hover. For the sidebar, I included some "Popular Baking Toolkits"; I considered that many people have to buy ingredients and tools when making a new recipe, so why not offering them all in one package? The website wins and the customer wins!</p>
                        <p>I conserved the same navigation bar because I considered it efficient and clean, and started adding some personality with fonts.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration1.png">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration1.png" class="button">Baking Wireframe</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <p>For the tech-savvy elderly audience, I took advantage of the tech-savvy part to implement more features such as a filters, newsletters, signup/login buttons and the ability to save articles. Also, the fact that they're tech-savvy made me realized that they're probably active on social media, therefore, I implemented some social network links and buttons. The overall structure remained very similar with these new implementations added.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/sketch2.jpg">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/sketch2.jpg" class="button">Tech-Savvy Elder Sketch</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <p>Out of all these features, I considered that the filter and the social media buttons would be the best ones, since the filter would allow to find a specific topic and the social media helps the user and the brand to stay connected. I recreated these features in the wireframe; then I added a bigger font size in general to help the elderly audience's eyes.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration2.png">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration2.png" class="button">Tech-Savvy Elder Wireframe</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <p>After creating the two medium fidelity wireframes, it was easy to continue developing them into high fidelity.</p>
                        <p>On the baking products focused iteration, I made the "Tools Used" button white with a drop shadow to make it stand out over the title and author of each article, the user can easily see it, and hover the mouse over to show the tools. Also, the sidebar shows the "Popular Baking Toolkits" with images to make the user curious. To make the sidebar more engaging, the toolkits could be based in season, for example, on Christmas many people want to cook special plates for their loved ones, so showing a toolkit with all the necessary items would be interesting to the user.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration1.2.png">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration1.2.png" class="button">Baking Iteration</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <p>On the final version of the tech-savvy elderly women iteration, you can see how text is bigger but without feeling overwhelming. The sidebar has some blog related Instagram posts coming from fans, it has some text that encourages social engagement between brand and user, and finally, there's some social media links to follow the Landing Fork and staying connected.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                            <figure>
					       <img src="./images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration2.2.png">
                            <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/7_Iterations/iteration2.2.png" class="button">Tech-Savvy Elder Iteration</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
				        </div>
                        <h4>Outcome and What I Learned</h4>
                        <p>This project taught me how to repurpose a design to met different needs in audiences. Many websites have more than one audience, so being able to design with these different people in consideration is an important skill. I also learned to develop a design from a low fidelity wireframe to a high fidelity, I learned to compare different ideas to chose the best fitting one; finally, I understood that different users have different needs, and as designers, we need to find the way to make everyone happy.</p>
