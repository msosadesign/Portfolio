						<h3 class="page__main__title">Prototype of a Weather App</h3>
						<p>I consider this as one of my best projects, I was asked to design a high fidelity prototype of a Weather App, consisting on an Overview of the current time and upcoming days, and a Daily Details page. I wanted an experience that felt different, clean and efficient, and after looking for inspiration from other weather apps, I designed this. This is what I believe design should be like: nonconventional, different and unique.</p>
                        <p>That’s why I’m proud of this work.</p>
                        <p>
                        While working on this project, I learned how to refine a design from simple wireframes to high fidelity prototypes with interactivity. I learned to tweak little differences that together make a big change. And I learned to implement design principles like color and hierarchy, to make an enjoyable design</p>

                        <h4>Project's Problem</h4>
                        <p>The objective of this project was making a weather app, easy enough. My task was making a prototype based on two main screens: the overview and the daily details: the overview is what is going on currently and the daily details is what will happen on a certain day (or today).</p>
                        <p>The "problem" was coming up with the design of the screens, how to organize them and make an organized and tidy design. My solution, once that I had the wireframes, was experimenting, changing sizes, position, colors, to see what is most pleasing to the eye (and then asked my brother). The interactivity is easy to implement once you have a solid design. A design that works.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">

				        </div>
                        <h4>Project's Audience</h4>
                        <p>The company that gave me this project didn't ask me to define a target, but out of the top of my mind, I guess the audience would be active people, probably workers or students, who need to be sure how to dress up before going out and have a smartphone.</p>
                        <p>I can imagine a big manager who has to take a train to a certain part of the country and doesn't want his suit to get ruined by unexpected weather.</p>
                        <h4>Process</h4>
                        <p>My first step was to find inspiration so I looked at different weather apps and took notes of what I like and what I didn’t liked. I added everything in pen & paper iterations and decided which elements I liked to implement them on a more refined version, so I made a digital wireframe and refine it until arriving to the medium fidelity wireframe. From this it was easy just adding the colors, background and fonts.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
					       <img src="./images/Projects/4_Weather/DailyDetails.png">
				        </div>
                        <h4>Outcome and What I Learned</h4>
                        <p>The result was these two screens, which eventually could be modified to cover every possible outcome. And for myself, I learned about details, details take you away from the bigger picture but details can change the bigger picture, at least with design. Besides this, I learned about applying design principles effectively to met the user's purpose and needs and make design-friendly prototypes. Also, I learn to ask feedback, from my brother.</p>
