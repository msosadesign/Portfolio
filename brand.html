						<h3 class="page__main__title">Hunger no More Brand Identity</h3>
						<p>I find writing interesting so this project was engaging for me. Hunger No More is a charity site focused on fighting world hunger and they asked me to give them a Brand Identity. I started from analyzing their Personality to see what would fit, and I thought that as a Charity, they should have an optimistic approach and need to seem trustworthy so I thought that they would be like a friend: helps you understand that every problem has a solution and gives you a hand to solve it.</p>
						<p>In this project, I learned about emotional copywriting, how to write content in a way that shows a response on users and how to make a brand stronger. I must say, I liked the idea to design based on evoking emotion and sentiments on the users.</p>
						<h4>Project's Problem</h4>
						<p>My responsibility in this project was wireframing the homepage of Hunger no More, a charity with the objective of eradicating world hunger. The main point of this wireframe was building the personality of the website, to make it more human and connecting it to its users. I used UX Design content and copy writing to give life into the wireframe.</p>
                        <h4>Project's Audience</h4>
                        <p>Anyone can help with a charity, however, to be more specific, the audience, would be required to have an internet connection and quite possible, a credit card that allows them to make payments on the internet. Therefore, people that have a credit card and internet. The internet is accessible by many people today, but credit cards are a bit more limited and if someone creates one, it's because they have money to store. Therefore, users would be between 16 and 60 years old (max 60 years old because the big majority of elders don't have internet or doesn't know how to use it). Finally, it would be illogical that someone that needs the money would give it to a charity, therefore, the audience would have at least a medium socioeconomic level that allows them to make this type of payments.</p>
                        <h4>My Process</h4>
                        <p>My first step was defining the personality: the company values are honesty, compassion, respect, and service to others; being a charity they must be trustworthy so a little of formalness complemented with a fun, warm and inclusive personality should give the visitors a feeling of being affective yet serious in what they do with the charity. The objective is to be formal enough to be trustworthy, friendly enough to be interesting and make hunger seem like a problem we can solve, but only with the visitor’s help. It’s like an old friend who helps you smile despite the problems and is still reliable about solving them.</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
					       <img src="./images/Projects/8_Brand/personality_table.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>I was given a template to start the wireframe, consisting on this structure:</p>
                        <div class="project__media" style="text-align: center">
                           <figure>
                               <img src="./images/Projects/8_Brand/template.png">
                               <figcaption><a href="images/Projects/8_Brand/template.png" class="button">Template</a></figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                        <p>From here, with the personality defined and the template made, it wasn't necessary to make a sketch, in this project, the text was more important.</p>
                        <p>I started with the heading and the first call to action. This is the most important section since it's the first thing that users read and it's where the personality is defined. It's exactly like when you introduce yourself to a new person, the first thing you say will define the other's person perception of you. Returning to the wireframe, I wrote it with a light and friendly tone, explaining briefly what we do, and what we need you (the user) to do. Of course, it shouldn't feel like an order, but rather an invitation, that's why it's written like a question. Then there's the "Donate" button, clear and easy to understand.</p>
                        <p>The next section is personally my favorite one, I used UX Inspiring content to give users the motivation to help the world, and what I liked about this section, is that you can see how many dollars have been donated today. Not only can users see that there's people already helping today, but they can see their own contributions in real time, I believe that if users can see the immediate result of their actions, they're more prone to help. Also, the text would explain how many dollars are needed daily. If we showed how many we needed in total, it would be a really big number, however, showing the daily requirement, gives a sensation of being tinier and more obtainable.</p>
                        <p>Then I continued with the Descriptive UX content, to explain the process, and how, the money given by the user arrives to the hands that need it. This section explain how everything starts with the user, and then progresses to fulfill the objective of the charity. It's easy! I also added a tiny map for a more visual understanding.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the next column would have some transparent UX content, this helps build trust with the users. Showing them the reality of the situation makes the brand seem believable, instead of a forced positivist charity. I Implemented a chart that visually shows where the money is spent, this would demonstrate the users that the founders are just getting a fraction of the real number, and that most of it will help reach the charity objective. Also, there's some statistical data like people helped so far, and the future plans, that shows how, after reaching a certain amount of donations, the charity would be able to expand to more locations. Finally, there's a map showing where the charity has helped, to allow the user see that they have already been places, and that with their help, they can reach many more! The last section would be the final call to action. I wrote it in a way that wraps things up and encourages the user to donate, even with the smallest amount of money, because it still helps a lot.</p>
                        <p>After writing everything, I was done, I just checked the spelling, added icons to complement the information and gave it a last look. Check it out!</p>

                        <h4>Outcome and What I Learned</h4>
                        <p>The main thing that I learned from this project was defining a brand personality, and writing copy based on this personality. I understood how to use different types of UX content to communicate an idea on a new way to the user, and overall, this project taught me to give more life to the copy of a product with emotional values.</p>
